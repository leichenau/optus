Question 1
solution is under truncate folder
source code is under src/main/java folder
exam.controller.SubscriptionController; exam.service.OrderDetailParserService; exam.service.TruncateService;
exam.service.TruncateServiceImpl;

test code is under src/test/java folder
exam.service.TruncateServiceImplTest

Used spring framework 
TruncateService, OrderDetailParserService are injected into SubscriptionController

OrderDetailParserService is a stub to make sure SubscriptionController compile
TruncateService define truncate method and implemented by TruncateServiceImpl.
TruncateServiceImpl is implemented with TDD, TruncateServiceImplTest define test cases based on  example and then implemented. 

Question 2

The solution is under bashtest folder
replaceTokens.sh is the script.
input/input.html has the template
config/prod.properties and config/prod.properties are property files
output is the output folder

Firstly, it read input file into template_content
Secondly, it read property file and loop through the propperties and replace the place holders in template_content
Lastly, it write the updated template_content into output file

example commands:
./replaceTokens.sh ./input/input.html ./config/test.properties ./output/output.html
./replaceTokens.sh ./input/input.html ./config/prod.properties ./output/output.html
